## Top Level Files

- ```.gitignore]: ```[.gitignore](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-gitignore-file) is important to
avoid putting unnecessary and insecure information into GitHub.


- ```LICENSE```: Choosing the 
[best license](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)
for a project may be important and require careful thought.

## Python Virtual Environment

- Using a [python virtual environment] is a best practice.


- This projects virtual environment is in ```venv```.


- The ```.gitignore``` file is the default for python from GitHub and prevents pushing the virtual environment into
the repo.


- ```main.py``` is the python application launched to start the web service.
